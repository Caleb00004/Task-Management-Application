# Task Manager Application

## Description
This is a full-stack task management application built using the MERN stack. The frontend is developed with Next.js, while the backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This application allows users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks efficiently.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

## Project Setup

### Cloning the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Caleb00004/Task-Management-Application.git
cd Task-Management-Application
```

## Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

```
> cd frontend
> npm install
```

Start the development server:
```
> npm run dev
```

## Backend Setup (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)
Navigate to the backend directory and install the dependencies:
```
> cd backend
> npm install
```

Ensure MongoDB is running on your system. You can start the backend server with:
```
> node index.js
```
This will start the backend server on http://localhost:5000.

### Usage Instructions
- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend of the application.
- The frontend communicates with the backend server running on http://localhost:5000 to perform CRUD operations on tasks.
- For detailed information on the API endpoints and how to use them, refer to the documentation file located in the backend directory.

### API Documentation
A detailed documentation file is available in the backend folder that describes how to use all the endpoints. This includes:

- Endpoint URLs
- HTTP methods
- Request parameters
- Response format
